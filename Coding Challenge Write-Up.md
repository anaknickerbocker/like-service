# Coding Challenge

## Description

Create a Like Service that accepts a photo identifier and a user identifier, and returns the number of likes for a
photo.

## Back-end, front-end, or full stack?

**Back-end track**: include a minimal front-end (e.g. static view or API docs). Write, document and test your API as if
it will be used by other services.

## Technical choices

I chose to create a mono-repo using [Nx](https://nx.dev/), with a React front-end and an Express back-end.

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Formatting**: Prettier
- **ESlint**: static analysis

This application is hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
